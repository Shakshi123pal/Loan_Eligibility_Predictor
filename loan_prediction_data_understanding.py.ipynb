    "###  Initial Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset contains 614 rows and 13 columns.\n",
    "- There is a mix of categorical and numerical variables:\n",
    "  - Categorical: Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, etc.\n",
    "  - Numerical: ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, etc.\n",
    "- Missing values are present in several columns such as\n",
    " `Gender`,`Married`,`Dependents`,`Self_Employed`,`LoanAmount`,`Loan_Amount_Term`,`Credit_history`(to handle in Day 3)\n",
    "- ApplicantIncome ranges from very low to quite high, indicating a diverse applicant pool.\n",
    "- LoanAmount values are relatively small (usually under 400), possibly due to being recorded in thousands.\n",
    "- The target variable `Loan_Status` is slightly imbalanced, with more approvals ('Y') than rejections ('N').\n",
    "\n",
    "These insights guide the preprocessing steps and help in selecting appropriate models and evaluation metrics.\n",
    "- we'll explore the relationships between features and loan approval in the next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Relevance & Business Understanding \n",
    "- Understanding how each feature relates to loan approval is essential for building a realistic and effective ML model. Here's a breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üßç ApplicantIncome:\n",
    "- Represents the main applicant‚Äôs income.\n",
    "- A higher income generally suggests better ability to repay the loan.\n",
    "-However, a low income doesn't always result in rejection ‚Äî other factors like CoapplicantIncome and LoanAmount also play a role.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë CoapplicantIncome\n",
    "- Income from a joint applicant (e.g., spouse, family).\n",
    "- Can boost total repayment capacity.\n",
    "- Useful when the primary applicant has a low income.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üí∞ LoanAmount\n",
    "- The amount requested as a loan (in ‚Çπ1,000s).\n",
    "- Should be reasonable compared to the total income.\n",
    "- High LoanAmount with low income may reduce chances of approval\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üïí Loan_Amount_Term\n",
    "- Duration to repay the loan (in months).\n",
    "- Longer terms (e.g., 360 months) reduce monthly payments (EMIs), making the loan easier to repay.\n",
    "- Shorter terms increase EMIs, requiring a higher monthly income.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üìà Credit_History\n",
    "- Indicates past loan repayment behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - 1: Good repayment history.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - 0: No or poor repayment history.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One of the most influential features. Applicants with a credit history of 1 are far more likely to get loan approval.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß Dependents\n",
    "- Number of dependents (children or family members).\n",
    "- More dependents = greater financial responsibility = potential repayment burden.\n",
    "- Applicants with fewer dependents may be seen as less risky.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üíº Self_Employed\n",
    "- Indicates whether the applicant is self-employed.\n",
    "- May imply irregular income, so some banks consider it riskier than salaried income.\n",
    "- However, high-income self-employed applicants can still qualify easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üèòÔ∏è Property_Area\n",
    "- Indicates where the property is located: Urban, Semiurban, or Rural.\n",
    "- Urban and semiurban areas might offer better infrastructure or resale value.\n",
    "- Rural areas may need stronger financials to offset perceived risk."
